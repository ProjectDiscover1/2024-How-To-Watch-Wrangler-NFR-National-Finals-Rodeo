If the National Finals Rodeo is the Super Bowl of rodeo, the All-Around title is the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and for the first time since 2019, it’s guaranteed to change hands this year. Five-time back-to-back champion Stetson Wright is still recovering from an injury he sustained at last year’s event, which has blown the competition wide open.

It's Tie-Down Roping stand-out Shad Mayfield who enters the finals atop the All-Around standings, though with Wright expected to return to competition next year, the Bull Riding rookie Wacey Schalla and 2016 All-Around champion and Team Roping specialist Junior Nogueira also have a rare chance to be amongst the favourites.

A number of contenders are peaking just at the right time, most notably Bareback Riding's Jess Pope, and Barrel Racing's Hailey Kinsel, while Damian Brennan and Mayfield have near-insurmountable leads in Saddle Bronc Riding and Tie-Down Roping, respectively.

The Steer Wrestling competition has real feel-good potential, with perennial nearly-men Dakota Eldridge and Will Lummus hoping to do enough to reel in hot-shot Dalton Massey and fend off the reigning five-time champion Tyler Waguespack as he eases his way back after injury.
